<h1>Notes about HTML - for study-purposes</h1>

The <span> </span> tag is used for grouping and applying styles to inline elements. 
Which is different from the <div> </div> tag which is used for grouping and applying styles to block-level content. 

To use Javascript inside the html dokument without creating a new .js file the javascript code can be wrapped within <script type="text/javascript">code here</script>.
